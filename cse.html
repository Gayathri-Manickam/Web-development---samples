The Department came into being in 1984 since the inception of the college. The Department has 547 pentium and above computers accommodated in 9 computer centres with recent software and internet facility to feed the art of computer science to our budding engineers. Our computer centre is kept open even after the college hours to help the students to raise their programming skills using current and latest software tools. Students are permitted to utilize the computer centre during all the morning, 
evening session and also on saturdays for increasing their programming skill using conventional and latest software tools.
